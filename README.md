# **Project Insight**

As a professional analyst at digital game emporium 'Ice', I have been entrusted with the responsibility of discerning patterns capable of predicting the success trajectory of video games. The goals of this project would allow us to pinpoint games with the most potential and design their advertising campaigns accordingly. Herein lies a summary of insights that derived from the completion of this project.

The examination and graphical representation of the data led to the discovery of several interesting trends:

1. In general, a platform reaches its zenith in popularity seven years post-peak, typically gauged at around $100 million in annual sales. Nevertheless, the popularity of a platform may witness a resurgence, contingent on the manufacturing company. For instance, the PS platform often experiences a surge in popularity after two years, while the Wii and X360 products may require up to five years to ascend in popularity.
2. It can be more reasonable to asserted that there is no significant correlation exists between ratings given by critics and users and sales performance.
3. The platform preference differs by region, as detailed below:
   - North America (NA) favors X360, PS2, Wii, PS3, and DS
   - Europe (EU) leans towards PS2, PS3, X360, Wii, and PS
   - Japan (JP) prefers DS, PS, PS2, SNES, and 3DS
4. Despite regional differences, genre preferences remain strikingly similar:
   - NA = Action, Sports, Shooter, Platform, Misc
   - EU = Action, Sports, Shooter, Racing, Misc
   - JP = Role-Playing, Action, Sports, Platform, Misc

These analytical findings provide some strategic implications to be considered by the marketing team:

1. Platform Preference: Given the data trends, it is advised to focus on promotional efforts for PS4 and XOne platforms, as they continue to indicate a robust growth trajectory in sales.
2. Genre and Rating Preference: Focusing on the promotion of games within the "Action" genre bear an "E (Everyone)" rating, particularly in the North American market, could be beneficial. This genre and rating amalgamation has demonstrated steadfast popularity across all regions.
3. Geographical Considerations: It's vital to take into account the varied preferences for platform usage and genre across different geographical regions.
4. Timing of Promotion: The findings suggest that promoting games on more established platforms, such as the PS4 and XOne, could potentially yield better returns compared to the promotion of games on new released platforms.
